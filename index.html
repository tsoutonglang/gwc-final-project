          <p class="information">A few million years ago the world was flourishing and teeming with life.  Plants were lush, animals were healthy, and the world was at
          peace. With human activity and modern advancements, planet Earth has slowly been decaying more and more over the years. Animals are especially
          impacted by our actions and have been dying or unable to survive in their natural habitats. A particularly important area are the sea or water creatures
          that are impacted by humans. Thousands of people are constantly throwing trash into waters and harming the animals. Pollution also contaminates the waters and
          causes animals to become ill with disease. These animals are dying at an alarming rate and becoming more rare.</p>
          <p class="information">It has been brought to our attention that the situation is only getting worse and it is our responsibility as humans to fix
          the problem we started. We hope that through our interactive game and resourceful website people will become more aware and desire to help the animals.</p>

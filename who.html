        Chloe
        <br> Hi my name's Chloe! I'm 16 years old and I love running, photography and writing. I have two brothers, one older and one younger.
        <br>I have a dog named Harry who is 8 years old and I have a passion for reading. My main motivation for this project is to spread awareness for endangered animals
        and the harm humans are inflicting on our planet. My hope is that this website and game will make a change for the better.

        Hello, my name is Kathryn and I will be a junior this coming fall. I'm the youngest of four, and I also have four dogs. I enjoy reading, baking and traveling.
        I also enjoy learning about new and diffrent cultures have a passion for communnity service. This game, to me, is a fun way to bring awarness to the growing
        issues of pollution and its effect on animals as well as provide information as to how to prevent it.

        Litzy Bucio
        <br> Hello my name is Litzy. I am 17 years old. I go to Lincoln Park High School and this upcoming year I will be a senior.
        <br> One of my favorite things to do is play the cello. I have been playing the cello since I was ten years ols and fell in love with it
        <br> right away. Making this game to me means more people will be aware of some of the situations that are going on around the world.
        <br> Informing people of what's going will make them want to do something about it. If more people know and
        <br> want to take part of this change then the world will be a cleaner and better place!

        Tania Soutonglang<br>
        Hi my name is Tania. I'm sixteen years old, about to go into my junior year of high school, and I'm the oldest child with one younger sister. I enjoy learning new ways to create, travelling, swimming, and gaming.
        I joined this project because I care about how long this planet will last and the lives of sea creatures are one part of the ecosystem that is being effected by pollution.
        Being able to spread awareness of the issue through a video game is an oppotunity I didn't want to skip on.

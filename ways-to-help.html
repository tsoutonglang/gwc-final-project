  <h3>The Issue</h3>
    <p>Our constant production of waste has spilled throughpout the ocean making large bodies of waters today dumpsites for trash and chemical waste.
      This is endangering the animals who live and use it and have threatened the state of environment.
      Our overuse and lack of awareness of the impact that our actions have only caused the issue to progress,
      however if we were to become more aware and mindful, we could fight pollution and its detrimental effects.</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Ways To Help</h3>
        <p><b>Reduce Water Use:</b>
          <br>whether it be turning off the sink when you brush your teeth or taking a shorter shower, the water you save helps to prevent clean water shortages</p>
        <p><b>Be More Cautious:</b>
          <br>refrain from pouring oils or chemicals down household sinks and be careful what you flush down the toilet, they are drains, not a trash bin</p>
        <p><b>Don't Liter and Pick Up Any Trash:</b>
          <br>by keeping trash off the ground, you prevent it from getting into the sewer system and prevent it from making itâ€™s way into bodies of water</p>
        <p><b> DO NOT</b> throw liter into rivers, lakes and/or oceans.</p>
        </ul>

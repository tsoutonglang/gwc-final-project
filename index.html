      <!-- chloe's paragraph -->
      <p class="information">A few million years ago the world was flourishing and teeming with life.  Plants were lush, animals were healthy and the world was at peace. With human activity and modern advancements, planet earth has slowly been decaying more and more over the years. Animals are especially impacted by our actions and have been dying or unable to survive in their natural habitats. A particularly important area are sea or water creatures that are impacted by humans. Thousands of people are constantly throwing trash into waters and harming animals. Pollution also contaminates waters and causes animals to become ill with disease. Animals are dying at an alarming rate and becoming more rare. </p>
      <p class="information">It has been brought to our attention that the situation is only getting worse and it is our responsibility as humans to fix the problem we started. We hope that through our interactive game and resourceful website people will become more aware and desire to help the animals. Thank you for reading and enjoy the game!</p>

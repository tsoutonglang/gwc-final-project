        zombie attack (this is just a test)
        <br>y'all can delete this one later, I just wanted to test it all out and stuffffff. make sure to put your own bio and image too :)
        <br><br>oh and to make the pic into a circle <del>described in the best way the worst writer can describe anything</del>:
        <br><b>1:</b> go to picmonkey.com (you have to use an account to export, so like use mine username: satanicmeowmeow@gmail.com password:holdontillmay (don't bother trying to log into anything else of mine bc my passwords are all different lol))
        <br><b>2: </b>go to frames, the shape cutouts should be the first one
        <br><b>3: </b>change the circle to fit your pic however you want and keep it as a transparent and export the pic
        <br><b>side note: </b>you shouldn't have to worry about the size of the image bc I put some css code in here to auto size it :)

        <br> Hi my name's Chloe! I'm 16 years old and I love running, photography and writing. I have two brothers, one older and one younger.
        <br>I have a dog named Harry who is 8 years old and I have a passion for reading. My main motivation for this project is to spread awareness for endangered animals
        and the harm humans are inflicting on our planet. My hope is that this website and game will make a change for the better.

        issues of pollution and its effect on animals as well as provide information as to how to prevent it.

        Tania S.<br>
        Hi my name is Tania. I'm sixteen years old, about to go into my junior year of high school, and I'm the oldest child with one younger sister. I enjoy learning new ways to create, travelling, swimming, and gaming.
        I joined this project because I care about how long this planet will last and the lives of sea creatures are one part of the ecosystem that is being effected by pollution.
        Being able to spread awareness of the issue through a video game is an oppotunity I didn't want to skip on.
